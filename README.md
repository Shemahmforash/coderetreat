# Code Retreat

This is a python starting point example for the code retreat challenge.

## Requirements
You need to have python 2 or 3 installed on your system, please refer to: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## Run Tests
```
python test_game_of_life.py
```

## Dependencies
This starting point makes use of **unittest** from python's standard library, so it has no external dependencies.
In case you need external dependencies, it's useful to create a virtual environment first. To do so you can tools such as [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) or [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
